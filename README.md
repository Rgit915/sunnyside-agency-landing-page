## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

# What I learned

- **Structured Data with JSON**: Utilized JSON data structuring to avoid code repetition and efficiently manage content for the website.

- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Leveraged JSON data in React components for dynamic content rendering, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

- **State Management**: Implemented state management in React to handle link clicks and manage menu navigation, especially on smaller screens.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensured optimal layout and responsiveness across various screen sizes, improving the overall user experience.

- **Mobile Navigation**: Positioned and styled the navigation menu for smaller screens, enhancing accessibility and usability on mobile devices.

- **Design Consistency**: Strived to match the provided design as closely as possible, paying attention to details and maintaining design consistency throughout the project.


### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to further explore:

- Incorporating animations and transitions for a more interactive user experience.

### Useful Resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation is always my go-to resource for understanding React concepts and best practices.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The Tailwind CSS documentation provides comprehensive guidance on using Tailwind's utility classes effectively.
